If you are using PyPulse, consider the following to keep your environment secure:

- **Do not load untrusted web content** in embedded windows.
- Always **sanitize URLs and HTML content** passed into PyPulse.
- Run PyPulse applications with **least privilege** â€“ avoid running as root.
- Keep your **Python environment and dependencies updated**.
- Ensure you are using **secure Chromium flags** (disable remote debugging, enable site isolation, etc.).
